set(DOCUMENTATION "This module contains the base classes needed to implement
finite differences image filters. They include both sparse and dense finite
differences. Most of the classes in this module are abstract and therefore are
not intended to be instantiated by themselves.")

# If building this module with explicit template instantiation, the module will
# need to be built as a shared library, and its dependencies will need to be
# escalated from COMPILE_DEPENDS to DEPENDS.  These changes are needed to
# ensure template instantiations are linked and shared correctly.
